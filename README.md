Rendering HTML using Emacs Lisp... Why? To read mail containing HTML,
to read wiki pages, and so on, of course. As a light weight alternative
to w3... I guess that gives it away. Emacs now comes with its own
web browser called `eww` and it's own HTML rendering called `shr` so
this library is definitely no longer necessary. I'm just preserving it
here for posterity to look at. Enjoy, Emacs Archeologist of the future!
I salute you.
